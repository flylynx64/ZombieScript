  STRATEGY OVERVIEW
  Our strategy for this game is to play conservatively for as long as possible before going on the offensive. 
  In order to keep the player’s knowledge up to date, the player is scanning every other turn. On the turns that the player is not
  scanning, the player checks how close the nearest enemy is, the player’s current health, and the number of heals the player has left. 
  If the player has above 40% health and there is an enemy near, the player will attack. If the player has below 25% health and there is a 
  zombie near, then the player will move away or heal if possible. If it is not possible, then the player will attack. 
  If an enemy is far away or the player hasn’t scanned an enemy, then the player will move away. If the player doesn’t have many heals 
  left, that should signal that the player has survived for most of the game and enters the offensive part of the strategy. The player 
  begins to move closer to any scanned enemy or to the center if none are scanned.
